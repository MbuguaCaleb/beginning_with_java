**THE FUNDAMENTALS OF JAVA**
```
JDK (Java Development KIT)is a package of tools for developing Java-based software.
It the first thing you must have as you develop java applications.

The JVM is the Java platform component that executes programs.

```


**Anatomy of Java Program**
```
The smallest building block of a java program is a function.A function is a block of code that 
perform a task.

Function Anatomy

ReturnType Name(){

}

We begin by specifying the return type of the function.This is unlike many languages.
a function that does not return any of the datatypes is prefixed by void

Example
void sendEMail(){

}

A function can take arguments and they are known as parameters.
Note also that the left curly brace begins on the same line where we define our function.
Inside the braces is where we write our javacode.

```
**Entry Point**
```
Every java program should have at least one main function.Main is the entry point of our program. 
Every java class should have at least one class that contains the Main function.
main function is conatined within the main class.
A class is a container of related functions.

class Main{
void main(){

.....

}
}

A method is a function that is part of a class.
When a function exists out of a class it is a function.Inside of a class `

```
**Access Modifiers**
```
In java all classes and methods have got access mofifers.
These determine how the classes and methods can be accessed from the other classes.
They are used to determine how a particular class or method will be accessed from other classes or methods.

 public class Main{
    public void main(){
        ...}
}

To name Classes in java we use the PascalNamingConvention. 
To name methods we use camelCaseConvention.
